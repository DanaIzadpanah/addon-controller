                            New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty
                            describing its usage when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored
                            fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally
                            honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath
                            are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid
                            usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for
                            individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are
                            particular restrictions like, "must refer only to types
                            A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                            Those cannot be well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent
                            validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation
                            rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for
                            users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields are both
                            imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping
                            to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                            and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency
                            is on the group,resource tuple and the version of the
                            actual struct is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change
                            it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations,
                            updates to this type will affect numerous schemas.  Don''t
                            make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do
                            not control. Instead of using this type, create a locally
                            provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference.

                                For example, if the object reference is to a container
                                within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                                (where "name" refers to the name of the container
                                that triggered the event) or if no container name

                            New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty
                            describing its usage when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored
                            fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally
                            honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath
                            are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid
                            usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for
                            individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are
                            particular restrictions like, "must refer only to types
                            A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                            Those cannot be well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent
                            validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation
                            rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for
                            users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields are both
                            imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping
                            to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                            and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency
                            is on the group,resource tuple and the version of the
                            actual struct is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change
                            it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations,
                            updates to this type will affect numerous schemas.  Don''t
                            make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do
                            not control. Instead of using this type, create a locally
                            provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference.

                  description: 'ObjectReference contains enough information to let
                    you inspect or modify the referred object. --- New uses of this
                    type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage
                    when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields
                    which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion
                    and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid
                    usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual
                    usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular restrictions
                    like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored"
                    or "name must be restricted". Those cannot be well described when
                    embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are
                    different, the validation rules are different by usage, which
                    makes it hard for users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields
                    are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                    mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                    and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is
                    on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual struct
                    is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type
                    is embedded in many locations, updates to this type will affect
                    numerous schemas.  Don''t make new APIs embed an underspecified
                    API type they do not control. Instead of using this type, create
                    a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your
                    reference. For example, ServiceReferences for admission registration:
                    https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.17/admissionregistration/v1/types.go#L533
                    .'

                      description: 'If referring to a piece of an object instead of
                        an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go
                        field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                        For example, if the object reference is to a container within
                        a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                        (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                        the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]"
                        (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen
                        only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of
                        an object. TODO: this design is not final and this field is
                        subject to change in the future.'
